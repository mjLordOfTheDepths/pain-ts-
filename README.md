# Pain-ts-
## What is ts ?
Ts, or pain-this-, is a simple painting application created in the Rust programming language.

## Install ts
* Clone the repo
* cd into the src directory
* Build and run the repo using cargo.

## How do I use ts ?
* Run the program from the src directory
* Hold or press the left mouse button to draw
* Select a colour from the taskbar at the bottom of the screen
* Use the scroll wheel to change the brush size
* Press the cartridge icon on the bottom right of the taskbar to save your image to pain-ts-/my_pics
* NB: The final colour, on the palet, which is Magenta, is not actually magenta. It represents **transparency**
* [I have also added a pre-compiled windows executable file in the /src/ directory.]

## Vision
Inspired by software such as *Microsoft Paint 98* and *Temple-Os* as well as video-games such as *Spore* and *Ecosystem*, Pain-ts- contains a "Classic" game-mode which acts simply as a painting software. However, an "Eden" mode is currently in development.  
This Eden game-mode aims to allow players to draw worlds, creatures, and plants, and place their creatures and plants into their worlds to create a living eco-system.  
In essence, the full release of this software will contain an eco-system sandbox for the user to play around with.
